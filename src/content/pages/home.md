home_final_section_heading: About First Lutheran Ogdensburg
home_final_section_paragraph: >-
  First Lutheran Church is a family of sinners saved by grace through faith in
  the crucified and risen Jesus Christ. We love to worship God, laugh together,
  and lean on each other in good times and bad. Our mission is to love and serve
  God and love and serve people!

  Nestled in the scenic country woods of Ogdensburg, WI, just 10 miles from Waupaca's Chain of Lakes, we meet Sunday mornings at 9 a.m. at 700 Main Street in the village of Ogdensburg.
